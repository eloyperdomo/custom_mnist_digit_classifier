# custom_mnist_digit_classifier
In this notebook I use some basic pytorch functions and classes (F.cross_entropy, nn.Linear) to develop a deep learning model from scratch able to classify digits with 97% accuracy on validation set.
Also, I create my own implementation of fastai Learner class which allowed me to train the model much faster.
